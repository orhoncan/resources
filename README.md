Hey, Orhon here. B.A. and Ph.D. in Economics, MSc. in Financial Engineering and Risk Management. I have an average Internet connection (thanks to xDSL/DOCSIS technologies marketed as fiber), curiosity on a weird range of topics (you name it, i probably thought about it before), good research skills (somehow i was able to learn it) and zero self regulatory mechanisms (which is a no go in most cases). I teach economics, blockchain/cryptocurrencies and a little bit of behavioral finance whenever I get the chance. You can find some useful stuff I bump into during my researches here on this page (so I am basically taking notes for my future self). I may update this page regularly or not, even for once. The future is always ambigious.
