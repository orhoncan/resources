Hey, Orhon here. B.A. and Ph.D. in Economics, MSc. in Financial Engineering and Risk Management. I have an average Internet connection, curiosity on a weird range of topics, good research skills and zero self regulatory mechanisms. You can find some useful stuff I bump into during my researches here on this page.
